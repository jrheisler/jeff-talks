    "about": "This is a story about four young men; lifelong friends, who find themselves in a Zombie war. Being in their twenties, they all grew up on horror movies and video games. They watched every episode of The Walking Dead, and after each week's show, they spent the rest of the week tearing the show apart, covering all the 'what ifs', and 'why's' and filling it in with, \"If it was me, I woulda done ...\" So now they are in the middle of it and it's not a game. Now they have to do it for real. Can they? For my usual fans please don't stone me, I always swore I'd never write a Zombie book but I thought how much fun I could make it and so I did. It's not as gory in written form as of course Hollyweird would show it but it's hard to use the written word to convey somebody's guts being ripped out so I didn't bother. I hope you enjoy it and I expect to see a review saying yea or nea.\nYeah, I've gamed this stuff too and this is how I would do it, but I'd need some buddies watching my six.",
