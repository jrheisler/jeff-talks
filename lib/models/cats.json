They watched every episode of The Walking Dead, and after each week's show, they spent the rest of the week tearing the show apart, covering all the 'what ifs', and 'why's' and filling it in with, \"If it was me, I woulda done ...\" So now they are in the middle of it and it's not a game. Now they have to do it for real. Can they? For my usual fans please don't stone me, I always swore I'd never write a Zombie book but I thought how much fun I could make it and so I did. It's not as gory in written form as of course Hollyweird would show it but it's hard to use the written word to convey somebody's guts being ripped out so I didn't bother. I hope you enjoy it and I expect to see a review saying yea or nea.\nYeah, I've gamed this stuff too and this is how I would do it, but I'd need some buddies watching my six.",

After a brutal confrontation with a violent guard, the sentence was extended to five years, hard time.\n\nWorst of all, his father cut off all contact.\n\nFor five relentless years, Joshua was forced to defend himself against some of the toughest, most ruthless men in the world.\n\nIncredibly, he survived-and never gave up the desperate fight to prove to his father that he was innocent.\n\nEven more incredibly, along the way, Joshua learned the true meaning of strength-inner and spiritual-and discovered that empathy, compassion, and knowing when to walk away from a conflict is the purest form of strength.\n\n\nPRIVILEGE LOST is the true first-hand account of an \"everyday nice guy\" who had to fight for his life among some of the most violent and dangerous men alive, in some of the grimmest cages in the world. This gripping memoir explores the horrific violence he endured, traversing the bridge between adrenaline-pumping life and death moments and those deeply introspective agonies where Joshua came face to face with the reality behind his fantasies.\n\nAlong the way, he learned that true kindness can come from the most broken souls, and that so much of what we call justice is really just smoke and mirrors to protect those with power and privilege.\n\nWith humor and pathos, PRIVILEGE LOST looks across economic, cultural, racial, and religious boundaries with wide open eyes, confronting the harsh realities of a criminal justice system in deep need of reform.\n\nLike Piper Kerman's Orange is the New Black, Susanna Kaysen's Girl Interrupted, and Avi Steinberg's Running the Books, PRIVILEGE LOST is a deeply personal memoir, with a message of survival and growth that so many can relate to.",

If any plant were to shut down completely and be isolated from the grid, it will need an external source to restart, a complex procedure called “Black Start”.\n\nBlack Start is a novel that weaves the story of a highly competent Russian agent, Ivan Stravinsky, who has devised a scheme to replicate the conditions that attended the 2021 debacle in Texas, and then to disable the few unreliable and poorly maintained Black Start units scattered throughout the state. One small, independent-minded utility in West Texas is standing in his way as Stravinsky sets out to disrupt the entire economy of Texas.",

        "about": "So, I’ve finally done it! I’ve finally done what I never ever thought I would do–that being to revive the “old favorite”. In other words, dust the first fitness book I ever wrote off the shelves, and bring it back to life now!\n\nThat being the “evergreen” Fast and Furious Fitness–a book that received a tremendous reception back when I first released it in 2011–and judging from the 5000 plus fans on the Facebook page, is still going strong!\n\nAnyway, for whatever reason, and despite the positive response my first book received, I incredulously and astoundingly did not purse the idea any further. Although the intent was there, for whatever reason, I never pursued the idea. That is, until when I started Zero Excuses Fitness, that is.\n\nMark the date on your calendars, my friend–Monday October 15, 2018–and I’m starting off a new week with an old classic–a classic which has information that is still very relevant to everyone out there. If you’ve listened to Zero Excuses Fitness and enjoyed it, you’ll enjoy this as well.\n\nAnd hear me out on this one–although Zero Excuses Fitness was modeled on the Fast and Furious Fitness book, the two are NOT the same–and you’ll see what I mean when you listen to the book.\n\nFast and Furious Fitness has several routines and exercises that Zero Excuses Fitness doesn’t. Fast and Furious Fitness is a book that much like Zero Excuses Fitness, can be used by folks at all levels–especially for those of you at beginner levels, but the exercises in there will work just as well for advanced trainees as well.\n\nWhile the basic core of both the books are the same, the training philosophy differs. You’ll see a different spin on the same sort of topics throughout the entire book, and especially the 10 Commandments of Physical Success.\n\nBut now, the big question–if I’ve got Zero Excuses Fitness out there, and if it’s doing well, then why the fuss about Fast and Furious Fitness? Why resurrect it, as it were? Well, the answer to that one is simple my friend. It’s an old classic–and I love old classics. Whether it be Napoleon Hill’s Think and Grow Rich, Claude Bristol’s evergreen “The Magic of Believing” or “T.N.T.\"–the fact is that I love classics, and many of you do as well!\n\nWhat you’ll learn from this course:\n\nSolid training information emphasizing good old fashioned hard work, determination, and dedication.\nTraining programs that work–and are simple to do–and most importantly, get things done quickly.\nHow you can build loads of muscle on your calves and thighs, while at the same time building strength and endurance–all within 10 minutes or less!\nBuild a strong, functional midsection without doing a single crunch!\nDevelop brute strength throughout your entire back and upper body.\nHow to build huge forearms and develop the crushing power of an ape while your at it!\nThe one exercise that will build shoulders that have the strength of a male gorilla, and look like they are carved out of granite!\nAdvice on what sort of diet to follow for best gains.\nThe 10 commandments of any successful training regimen.",

        "about": "The American Civil War stands as one of the defining moments in the history of the United States. Fought between the Northern states, known as the Union, and the Southern states, known as the Confederacy, the war was a profound struggle for the preservation of the Union and the abolition of slavery. Lasting from 1861 to 1865, it claimed the lives of over 600,000 Americans and forever altered the nation's trajectory.\n\nIn the pantheon of significant battles during the Civil War, the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House holds a special place. Taking place from May 8 to May 21, 1864, in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, this brutal engagement pitted the forces of Union General Ulysses S. Grant against Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The battle would become a turning point in the war, marked by intense fighting, tactical innovations, and a grim determination to achieve victory at any cost.\n\nThe importance of the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House cannot be understated. It was a critical juncture in the larger conflict, serving as a fulcrum upon which the fate of the nation teetered. This battle emerged as a crucible where the mettle of the opposing armies and their commanders was tested, pushing the limits of military strategy and tactics. The outcome of this struggle would reverberate through the subsequent course of events and shape the war's trajectory.\n\nThe Battle of Spotsylvania Court House was a pivotal moment in the American Civil War, signaling a shift in strategy and setting the stage for the relentless pursuit of victory by General Ulysses S. Grant. This battle, characterized by its brutality and tactical innovations, not only showcased the resolve of the Union forces but also exposed the resilience of the Confederate Army under the leadership of General Robert E. Lee. Moreover, the battle's impact extended beyond its immediate aftermath, altering the dynamics of the war and paving the way for the eventual Union triumph.\n\nThis book delves into the depths of the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, unraveling the events that led to this significant clash and examining its consequences. It will provide a comprehensive account of the battle, shedding light on the strategies, tactics, and the sacrifices made by both sides. By exploring the struggles faced by the soldiers on the front lines, the decisions made by the commanding officers, and the societal implications of this protracted conflict, we aim to paint a vivid picture of this crucial turning point in the American Civil War.\n\nThroughout the following chapters, we will traverse the battlefields, maneuver through the trenches, and encounter the heroes and casualties of this brutal struggle. From the opening skirmishes to the decisive moments at the \"Bloody Angle,\" we will examine the intricate details of the battle, the stalemate that ensued, and the lasting consequences that reverberated across the nation.\n\nBy delving into the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, we can gain a deeper understanding of the pivotal moments that shaped the outcome of the Civil War. This battle serves as a testament to the endurance, valor, and sacrifice exhibited by the soldiers on both sides, as well as the strategic decisions and innovations that influenced the course of the conflict.",

        "about": "Collects Michael Brein's ghostly accounts of the nearly 2,000 interviews with travelers he has met in his own travels around the world over the last four decades.\n\nAlthough the typical travel stories collected in the True Travel Tales book series are ordinarily oriented towards safety and security in travel, the very scary and spooky accounts of ghosts and hauntings and all the variations in between can and do occur to travelers. Mostly these things will not happen to you. But you never know. You'll read in the series plenty of examples of the wide variety of spirit and ghost encounters that may pop up now and again in your travels as well as your own home life. \n\nThis book, however, pauses all of this. Instead of dealing with all sorts of true accounts of close calls and great escapes in connection with all sorts of scary travel situations including chases, foiled kidnappings, attacks, roadblocks, scary places, trips from hell, borders, and police, hitchhiking, international spying, smuggling, and intrigue, being in the wrong places at the wrong times, terror attacks, bandits, Mexican standoffs, airplane crashes, accidents and mishaps, white slavery, robberies, sexual harassment and assaults and more — the series now pauses to explore the spooky world of ghosts and spirits and many of the no doubt related variations in between!\n\nInstead of reading about the dangers and mishaps of others, whereby you'll focus on and gain healthier respect for the true dangers and risks of travel and adventure... the point of this book is purely to explore a virtually little known aspect of reality. By all means, haunted places abound, and where it was heretofore a forbidden subject to bring up, it is now relatively good sport to seek out haunted establishments and even to write down your experiences in a variety of guestbooks and ledgers provided at these establishments for just that purpose.\n\nAnd make no mistake, whereas some of these stories are profoundly scary and unnerving, many are the stuff of keepsake memories and smack of efforts on the part of spirits to be recognized and even be remembered.\n\nMany of the scary accounts of travelers in this book are tales of times gone by. Many ghosts seem to be intent on making others remember them. Other ghost experiences seem to be never-ending repeating replays of cycles of discarnate entities seemingly trying to resolve conflicts of times long gone by.\n\nYes, indeed, we are often the recipients of visits from ghosts and spirits on our own home turfs. It, therefore, behooves us to think of this book as not only a compendium of ghostly visits that we seek out or experience despite ourselves in our travels, but perhaps we ought to consider the visits of ghosts and spirits as similarly traveling themselves in a way from their own alternate space-time realities which conjoin or overlap with ours in one massive Contiguous Universe?\n\nIn this Reader or compendium of ghost and spirit tales, we broaden our look at not merely what we think of as the typical shadows, spirits, or apparitions reported by so many, but also to a much broader reality of similarly related behaviors of presumably a wide variety discarnate supernatural entities that cut across in mysterious ways broad swaths of what we may typically refer to as ghost or spirit visitations and their interactions with us.\n\nSuch ghostly encounters may not ever happen expressly to you, but assuredly something strange of an apparitional manifestation will invariably happen to a friend, a neighbor, or perhaps even a relative.",
